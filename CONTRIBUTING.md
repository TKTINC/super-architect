# Contributing to Super-Architect AI Agent

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Super-Architect AI Agent project. This document provides guidelines for contributing to this enterprise-grade AI development assistance platform.

## Development Process

### 1. Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TKTINC/super-architect.git
cd super-architect

# Set up development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 2. Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### 3. Commit Standards

Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## Code Standards
